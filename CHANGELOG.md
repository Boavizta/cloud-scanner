## [0.0.8] - 2022-11-13

### Added

- Option to returns metrics through an http endpoint (Start the CLI with `cloud-scanner serve`). Metrics are recalculated each time the endpoint is scraped for example at <http://localhost:8000/metrics?aws_region=eu-west-1>).  
âš  Running metric server in container require setting  extra variables:
  - to map AWS credentials 
  - to map SSL ca certificates 
  - and more importantly to configure rocket to listen to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 (which is internal to the container): `ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0`
``` sh
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 -v /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt -v $HOME/.aws/credentials:/root/.aws/credentials:ro -e ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 -e ROCKET_PORT=8000 -e AWS_PROFILE=$AWS_PROFILE ghcr.io/boavizta/cloud-scanner-cli:latest serve
```

- Fix wrong default API url in CLI and serverless environment, see <https://github.com/Boavizta/cloud-scanner/issues/125>
- Use a public crate to provide boavizta-api-sdk . Previous version relies on local SDK code in this repository. This SDK is now maintained in its own repository at <https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi-sdk-rust> (see <https://github.com/Boavizta/cloud-scanner/issues/112>).
