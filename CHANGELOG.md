## [Unreleased]

- Support scanning a region different from where the lambda is deployed.
- Use the instances workload (cpu) to tune the results.
- Use a published/versioned crate of boavizta-api-sdk (actual version relies on local sdk).

## [0.0.4] - 2022-06-24

### Added

- Serverless app supports `use hours_use_time` in default scan
  - passed as request parameters (example query `https://xxxxx.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/scan?hours_use_time=10`
  - this parameter is mandatory
- Update serverless app to use `aws_region` in default scan
  - ⚠ This _optional_ parameter is not yet supported by the scanner lib (which always defaults to the default region of the lambda)

## [0.0.2] - 2022-06-10

### Added
