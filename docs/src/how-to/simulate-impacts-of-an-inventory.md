# Get impacts of an arbitrary inventory

This is useful to simulate the impacts of a non-existing infrastructure or a variant of existing infrastructure.

This involves building an inventory file and passing it to cloud scanner for evaluation.

1. describe an arbitrary inventory (the to-be infrastructure) as a json file.
2. request cloud scanner to estimate impacts of this inventory. 

ðŸ’¡ It may be easier to adapt an existing inventory file, rather than creating it from scratch. See [Estimate the impacts of an existing inventory](estimate-from-existing-inventory-file.md).
